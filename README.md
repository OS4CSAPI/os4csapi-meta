# üß≠ OS4CSAPI Meta Repository

This repository serves as the central planning and coordination hub for the **Open Source for OGC API ‚Äì Connected Systems (OS4CSAPI)** initiative. It supports transparent workflows, contributor onboarding, sprint planning, and architectural alignment across all participating projects.

## üìò Purpose

The `os4csapi-meta` repo was created to migrate coordination from personal repositories to a fully public, contributor-friendly space. It anchors the OS4CSAPI organization and links directly to our project board and Discussions forum.

## üìã Project Workspace

Track sprint goals, planning, and implementation progress in our org-level GitHub Project:

üëâ [OS4CSAPI Project Workspace](https://github.com/orgs/OS4CSAPI/projects/1)

Contributors can:
- Link issues from any public repository of interest (no need to formally link the repo)
- Formally link a repository to the organization if deeper integration is desired
- Track progress across agile columns (Backlog ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Done)
- Filter by repo or status using board views
- Coordinate implementation efforts aligned with CSAPI goals

## üí¨ Discussions

Join the conversation in our [Discussions tab](https://github.com/OS4CSAPI/os4csapi-meta/discussions) to:
- Plan sprints and implementation threads
- Ask questions and share ideas
- Align on standards and architecture
- Propose new repositories, use cases, or issue links

## üß© Participating Projects

We collaborate with upstream and downstream open-source efforts to validate, prototype, and implement CSAPI features. Contributions often begin by linking issues from external repositories. Some examples include:

- [opensensorhub](https://github.com/opensensorhub)  
- [52North/connected-systems-pygeoapi](https://github.com/52North/connected-systems-pygeoapi)  
- [geopython/OWSLib](https://github.com/geopython/OWSLib)  
- [camptocamp/ogc-client](https://github.com/camptocamp/ogc-client)  
- [qgis/QGIS](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS)  
- [nlsfi/hakunapi](https://github.com/nlsfi/hakunapi)  
- [ConnectedSystemsAPI-Java](https://github.com/Botts-Innovative-Research/ConnectedSystemsAPI-Java)

## ü§ù Contributor Onboarding

New members are granted base permissions to fork, create, and link repositories. To get started:

1. Review this README and the [org-level README](https://github.com/OS4CSAPI/.github)

3. Link issues to the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/OS4CSAPI/projects/1) from any relevant repo  
4. Propose new implementation threads or formally link a repo to the organization

## üìê Standards Alignment

All work in this organization aligns with the [OGC API ‚Äì Connected Systems v1](https://www.ogc.org/standards/ogc-api-connected-systems/) specification. We prioritize semantic clarity, traceability, and conformance across all implementation efforts.
